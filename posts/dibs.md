<p>Fed up with scouring the Internet night and day in search of a mint condition 80's Toyota Land Cruiser, I decided to build a website to do the searching for me.</p>

<p>Dibs was a service I built that constantly scraped all of the latest listings from the largest vehicle marketplaces in New Zealand. It allowed users to create alerts that would email them as soon as a listing matching their search appeared.

The benefit of a service like this was two-fold. Firstly, users searching for a new car didn’t need to browse all of the services individually to find good listings, as Dibs aggregated everything into a single service. The other benefit being for classic car enthusiasts, as sometimes being first matters (I’ve learnt this myself). Being notified within 15 minutes of a listing being posted means that the user will be the first to respond to the post, or view the car, which for some listings could be crucial.

The plan was for Dibs to eventually transform into a general product search engine, expanding into property was the natural next step. Unfortunately, reality hit and I quickly ran through my savings forcing me to get back into the job market. With that said, I wouldn't change a thing - it was an incredible experience and through the failure I learnt a lot.
