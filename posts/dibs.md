<p>Fed up with scouring the Internet night and day in search of a mint condition 80's Toyota Land Cruiser.. I decided to build a website to do the searching for me.

Dibs is a service that constantly scrapes all of the latest listings from the largest vehicle marketplaces in New Zealand. It also allows users to create alerts that will email them as soon as a listing matching their search reaches a marketplace, and give them information on that listing.

Check it out in action below or have a go yourself at <a href="https://www.dibs.ai">https://www.dibs.ai</a>.
