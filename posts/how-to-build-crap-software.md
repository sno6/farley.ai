<p>Create an incentive scheme that doesn't align the success of the software with the success of the individuals involved in building the software.</p>
<p>Treat time and quality as two independent concepts.</p>
<p>Build a solution to a problem that you don't care about.</p>
<p>Don't respect the end user. Your obligation is to yourself and the shareholders.</p>
<p>Don't have opinions. Let others drive the roadmap.</p>
<p>Disregard craftsmanship, pure functionality is the focus.</p>
<p>Always future proof your solutions. Abstract away the details that you think might change. You know best right now.</p>
<p>Gain a first mover's advantage and exploit it. Your captive users are just grateful to have a solution, there's no reason to improve it.</p>
<p>Move fast and break things, then build on top of the rubble.</p>
<p>Don't hire based on evidence of excellence. Good talkers must be good builders.</p>
<p>Spend a disproportionate amount of time on the leaves of the tree and not the trunk or root structure.</p>
<p>Disregard compounding effects, both positive and negative (friction).</p>
<p>Treat software development like constructing a statue. Once it has been etched in marble it only requires surface level maintenance.</p>
<p>Get as many things 80% of the way there as possible. That last 20% is a waste of time.</p>
<p>Treat perfect as the enemy of good, and good as good enough for the user.</p>
<p>Disregard the emotional connection between your software and the user. Your software is purely a blunt hammer for their nails. Splinters and all.</p>
<p>Polish is something you apply as an after thought - if at all.</p>
<p>Follow the conventional wisdom even if it doesn't make sense to you. They must know best.</p>
<p>When a road leads to a dead end, proceed or rollover, never adjust your assumptions.</p>
<p>Treat all decisions as one way doors. Consider every possible outcome before proceeding, and even then, proceed slowly and with caution.</p>
<p>Trust the opinions of those less familiar with the intimate details.</p>
<p>A single team should not be able to ideate, create, and then deploy their idea into the hands of users.</p>
<p>Start at an engineering informed solution and work your way back to a customer solution.</p>
<p>Do not treat software like an optimisation process. Cycles in which you test and adjust your assumptions should be few and far between.</p>
