<p>Hey reader,</p>

<p>My name is Farley and I’m a software developer from Auckland, New Zealand. I’m currently a backend engineer @ <a href="https://www.zapier.com">Zapier</a> and before that I worked for a digital agency called <a href="https://www.roamdigital.com">Roam</a>.</p>

<p>Happenstance would be the word I’d use to describe how I got involved with software. I was never an academic kid growing up, I preferred sports and skateboarding over using my head. It wasn’t until I came across an advertisement on a Youtube video for <a href="https://www.code.org">code.org</a> that everything started to come together. I played with the examples on the site, moving a robot from point A to point B, reading the explanations it gave on how the code correlated to the movement. And that was it, that was all it took to get me hooked. I spent the rest of the day playing with app builders and reading up on anything I could find on the web relating to this magic thing I’d just discovered. Fast forward 8 years later and I’m still as excited and intrigued as I was back when I was 16.</p>

<p>But that’s enough about me.</p>

<p>What you will find while you’re here are posts about my personal projects, ideas and discussions on anything I find interesting, and most likely machine learning tutorials and concepts. If you’re looking for my email address, that can be found in my résumé on the home page.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy,</p>
<p>Farley</p>
