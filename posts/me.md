<p>Hey,</p>

<p>I'm Farley, a software engineer from Auckland, New Zealand. Iâ€™m currently working @ <a href="https://www.zapier.com">Zapier</a> and before that I worked for a digital agency here in Auckland called <a href="https://www.roamdigital.com">Roam</a>.</p>

<p>
I started programming when I was 16 after clicking on a <a href="https://www.code.org">code.org</a> advertisement on the side of a Youtube video. It couldn't have come at a better time to be honest, I was failing school and didn't have much of a plan for the future. But I was instantly hooked. I hadn't been interested in academia before, yet something clicked when I started programming, and I realized I could do more with my head than I had previously thought. That led me to graduate from university in Auckland (AUT), and eventually start working in the industry. But most importantly it led me to a love of learning.
</p>

<p>
I created this website to post about personal projects and write about topics I find interesting. I hope you enjoy your time here, and if you would like to get in contact with me my email can be found on my resume on the home page.
</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Farley</p>
