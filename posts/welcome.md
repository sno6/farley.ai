Hello!</br>

Welcome to my new blog / mindless ramblings / project space.

The aim of this thing is to be a place where I can post in a bit more detail, all of the projects that I've been working on, as Github can be a bit limiting in that respect.

It will also be a place to jot down my thoughts while doing **machine learning** research, and potentially some tutorials on difficult concepts.

Cheers for checking it out,</br>
Farley
