Hello! and welcome to my new blog, or something. 

The aim of this thing is to be a place where I can post all of my latest projects and go into more detail than is allowed on Github.

It will also be a place to jot down my thoughts while doing ***machine learning*** research, and potentially some tutorials on difficult concepts.

Cheers for checking it out,</br>
Farley
